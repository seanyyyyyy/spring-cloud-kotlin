= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request
include::{snippets}/greeting/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/greeting/http-response.adoc[]

.response fields
include::{snippets}/greeting/response-fields.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.

.request
include::{snippets}/list-users/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/list-users/http-response.adoc[]
